# Sojourner
An (unofficial) extension of schema.org for modeling conceptual models

## Note
To design this ontolgy, Protège has been used. The schema.rdf file that is part of this project is the original schema.org rdf file. This file has been modified in order to be readable by Protège. Particularly,
* schema:domainIncludes has been replaced with rdfs:domain
* schema:rangeIncludes has been replaced with rdfs:range
* schema:DataType has been replaced with rdfs:Datatype

## File
* schema.rdf : the schema.org modified file
* catalog-v001.xml : autogenerated by Protège
* cellfie.log : log of the cellfie plugin (removed)
* minirules.json : rules used to load instances in Protège via Cellfie
* sojourner.owl : the ontology

## Folders
* diagrams : in it, you can find the EER diagrams used to generate our ontology
* report : this project has been developed for class 145919 (Knowledge and Data Integration) of the University of Trento. Both the reports linked to this project can be found in this folder
