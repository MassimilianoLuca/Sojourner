# Sojourner
An (unofficial) extension of schema.org to model conceptual models

## Note
To design this ontolgy, Protège has been used. The schema.rdf file that is part of this project is the original schema.org rdf file. This file has been modified in order to be readable by Protège. Particularly,
* schema:domainIncludes has been replaced with rdfs:domain
* schema:rangeIncludes has been replaced with rdfs:range
* schema:DataType has been replaced with rdfs:Datatype
